Hi Community,

This is a Python Telegram bot. It will inform you the Bitcoin Binance price, everytime you set up, it is very simple to use, no tricks.
The commands are /start /set /unset for example:

- If you want to be inform every X minutes about the price, just send /set X (/set 5 for 5 minutes)

- To stop the news just send /unset this will stop the news.

Hope you Enjoy it!
